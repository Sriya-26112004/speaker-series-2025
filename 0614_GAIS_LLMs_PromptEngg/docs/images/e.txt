## üß† Session Overview

Prompting is the art of crafting clear instructions for AI models using natural language.  
It helps guide the model‚Äôs reasoning, improve accuracy, and ensure structured and relevant responses.

---

## üß∞ Types of Prompting Techniques

### 1. Zero-Shot Prompting

> Ask the model to perform a task without giving any examples. Best for simple, common tasks.

**Use Cases:**
- Summarization  
- Translation  
- Direct question answering  

```text
Summarize the sentence: "Artificial intelligence is a rapidly growing field that focuses on building systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence."
```

---

### 2. Few-Shot Prompting

> Provide 2‚Äì3 examples to show the model what kind of response is expected.

**Use Cases:**
- Text formatting
- Pattern matching
- Style transfer

```text
Q: Convert 'data science' to PascalCase  
A: DataScience  
Q: Convert 'student login' to PascalCase  
A: StudentLogin  
Q: Convert 'account settings' to PascalCase  
A:
```

---

### 3. Chain-of-Thought Prompting

> Guide the model to explain its reasoning step-by-step.

**Use Cases:**
- Math problems
- Code analysis
- Logical reasoning

```text
Q: There are 10 cookies. Alice eats 3, and Bob eats 2. How many are left?  
Let's think step-by-step.
```

---

### 4. Prompt Chaining

> Break down complex tasks into multiple connected prompts.

**Use Cases:**
- Task automation
- Multi-step workflows

```text
Step 1 Prompt:  
Summarize the following GitHub issue: "The login button doesn't work on mobile devices running Safari."

Step 2 Prompt:  
Write a professional email to the mobile dev team with the summary:  
"The login button is broken on Safari mobile. Needs urgent fix."
```

---

### 5. Role Prompting

> Assign a persona or role to influence tone or expertise level.

**Use Cases:**
- Professional reviews
- Teaching or explaining concepts
- Simulated interviews

```text
You are a senior software architect.  
Please review the following microservices design for performance and scalability issues.
```

---

### 6. Self-Consistency Prompting

> Run the same prompt multiple times to compare answers.

**Use Cases:**
- Brainstorming
- Storytelling
- Metaphor generation

```text
Q: Calculate 15% of 240

Path 1:  
- 10% of 240 = 24  
- 5% is half of 10% = 12  
- Total: 24 + 12 = 36

Path 2:  
- Convert 15% to decimal: 0.15  
- Multiply: 240 √ó 0.15 = 36

Path 3:  
- Break down into: (240 √ó 10/100) + (240 √ó 5/100)  
- = 24 + 12  
- = 36
```

## ‚úÖ Best Practices for Prompt Engineering

- **Be clear & specific:** Avoid vague instructions.
- **Add context/examples:** Improve quality with samples.
- **Guide reasoning:** Use "Let's think step-by-step".
- **Assign roles:** Set tone and expertise.
- **Test multiple prompts:** Find what works best.
- **Break down tasks:** Use chaining for complex flows.
